I set out to use data and create a C++ project, to see if Steph Curry's impact on three point attempts correlated directly to winning. First I acquired data using 
webscraping programs in python I created for acquiring each dataset from tables, then I used this data to create csv files containing only the columns of data I
needed for this project. Then using these CSV files running my c++ program 'threepoint.cpp' more data is create and saved to a csv format so that it could be graphed 
using whatever tool the user likes to graph data. I then wrote a report making graphs in apples Numbers application from the csvs I created in my program. 
The report can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cW2tbcQh1hqbSSOMRpZgcoMzNn4LySddFT18ydqbFOQ/edit
How to run:
1)Put all contents of 'Do three point attempts correlate to winning in the modern Nba?' directory into a folder and then open the folder in IDE of choice.
2)Run threepoint.cpp and it should work.
